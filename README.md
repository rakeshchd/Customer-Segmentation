# Customer-Segmentation
This GitHub repository focuses on analyzing an e-commerce database containing purchase records from approximately 4,000 customers over a one-year period (from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011). Based on this analysis, I have developed a model that predicts future purchases of a new customer during the subsequent year, starting from their initial purchase.
